# PgNinja ðŸ¥·

**A lightweight Windows tray utility to manage your local PostgreSQL server.**

PgNinja is a minimalist system tray application for Windows that lets you easily **start**, **stop**, and **restart** your locally installed PostgreSQL server with a single click.

It automatically detects your PostgreSQL service, reflects the current server status with a colored tray icon (green for running, red for stopped), and ensures the proper permissions by requesting administrator elevation when needed.
